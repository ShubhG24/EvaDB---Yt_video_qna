This app lets you ask questions about any YouTube video, and will only need to supply a Youtube URL and an OpenAI API key. Additionally, you can ask the app to generate a well-formatted blog of the video for you.  This app is powered by EvaDB, a Python-based database system for AI applications developed by Georgia Tech's DB Group.
